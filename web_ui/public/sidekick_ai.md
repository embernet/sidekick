You can access diagram prompts from the prompt editor menu or by pressing "/" in an empty prompt.

### Chat Tips, Questions and Answers

- If you want a quicker chat response and your questions are not complex then try using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. If you want a more complex response then try using the GPT-4 model. You can change the model in the Model Settings window.
- Why delete messages from the chat? Curating the chat history by deleting individual messages that were not what you wanted can be a useful way to improve the AI's responses. The chat history is sent back to the AI each time you send a new prompt, so deleting messages that were not what you wanted can help the AI learn what you do want.
- Chats are automatically named. New empty chats are named "New Chat" until you interact with it to create some content. If this is their name when you enter a prompt, they will be automatically given a name based on the text in the prompt.
- Chat's can change course over time. Click the regenerate name button next to the chat name if you want to update the name to reflect the current content of the chat.

## Model Settings

**How to access Model Settings:** Click on the Model Settings button, whcih is the graphic equalizer icon in the Sidekick toolbar.

- Select the top k value from the Top K dropdown list

### Model Settings Tips, Questions and Answers

- **What is Temperature?** Temperature is a model setting that takes a value between 0 and 2 inclusive. 0 is the most consistent 'best' prediction. Up to 0.9 allows more creativity and variability. Above 1, the model is more 'creative' but can hallucinate more and make spelling and grammar mistakes.
- **What is top_p?** Top_p is a model setting that takes a value between 0 and 1 inclusive and provides an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
- **What is presence_penalty?** Presence_penalty is a model setting that takes a value between -2 and 2 inclusive. Positive values penalise new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
- **What is frequency_penalty?** Frequency_penalty is a model setting that takes a value between -2 and 2 inclusive. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
