- Class Diagram
- Perimeter Diagram
- Entity Relationship Diagram
- State Diagram
- Timeline
- Gantt Chart

You can also use these as a basis for describing your own dirgam types within the limitations of what mermaid supports.
You can access diagram prompts from the prompt editor menu or by pressing "/" in an empty prompt.

### Chat Tips, Questions and Answers

- If you want a quicker chat response and your questions are not complex then try using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. If you want a more complex response then try using the GPT-4 model. You can change the model in the Model Settings window.
- Why delete messages from the chat? Curating the chat history by deleting individual messages that were not what you wanted can be a useful way to improve the AI's responses. The chat history is sent back to the AI each time you send a new prompt, so deleting messages that were not what you wanted can help the AI learn what you do want.
- Chats are automatically named. New empty chats are named "New Chat" until you interact with it to create some content. If this is their name when you enter a prompt, they will be automatically given a name based on the text in the prompt.
- Chat's can change course over time. Click the regenerate name button next to the chat name if you want to update the name to reflect the current content of the chat.

The references are replaced with the cell's value.

## Model Settings

**How to access Model Settings:** Click on the Model Settings button, whcih is the graphic equalizer icon in the Sidekick toolbar.

- Select the top k value from the Top K dropdown list

### Model Settings Tips, Questions and Answers

- **What is Temperature?** Temperature is a model setting that takes a value between 0 and 2 inclusive. 0 is the most consistent 'best' prediction. Up to 0.9 allows more creativity and variability. Above 1, the model is more 'creative' but can hallucinate more and make spelling and grammar mistakes.
- **What is top_p?** Top_p is a model setting that takes a value between 0 and 1 inclusive and provides an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
- **What is presence_penalty?** Presence_penalty is a model setting that takes a value between -2 and 2 inclusive. Positive values penalise new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
- **What is frequency_penalty?** Frequency_penalty is a model setting that takes a value between -2 and 2 inclusive. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
