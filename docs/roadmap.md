# Roadmap

The following ideas are in the pipeline for future releases. If you have any ideas for features you'd like to see, please raise an issue.

- Help
  - Guided tour on first login
- Configurability
  - UI editors for all settings
  - UI for creating, editing, deleting, and sharing personas
  - UI for creating, editing, deleting, and sharing prompt fragments categories and text
- AI Knowledge Library
  - Group knowledge notes into ontologies
  - Specify the type of knowledge notes, e.g. fact, concept, theory, etc.
  - Describe tne knowledge in a note in a way that allows the AI to add that note to its knowledge base for use in its response to a particular prompt. This enables optimisation of the limited context window to include relevant knowledge for the current prompt.
- Slash commands to be able to quickly perform actions, e.g.:
  - Global context:
    - `/chat` - create, open, ...
    - `/note` - create, open, ...
  - Withnin a tool context:
    - `/open`
    - `/close`
    - `/export`
    - `/import`
    - `/clone`
    - `/summarise`
  - `/persona` - change persona
  - `/prompt` - use a prompt template
  - `/knowledge` - load knowledge into the AI
  - `/help` - show help
- Organisation
  - Folders for notes and chats
  - Tags for notes and chats
- Support for additional AIs
  - Support to add custom integration with other AI APIs
  - AWS Bedrock support, e.g. Anthropic Claude2 model
  - Local AI model support, e.g. Llama2 variants
- Collaboration
  - Share personas, chats, prompt fragments, prompt templates, and notes with other users
  - Like shared items to crowdsource popularity to bring the best ones to the surface
  - Clone shared items to customise them or add them into your own collections
- Chat
  - Select multiple personas to have a chat or debate with eachother on a topic you specify, be able to pause their interaction and interject, and then resume
  - Provide a list of additional response preference prompts so you can select one that is added on top of the selected persona and what you enter to encapsulate your prefereneces as to the style, format, and lenghth of the response
  - Break a problem down into its constituent parts or considerations from different perspectives and use a divide and conquer approach to solve it with AI personas appropriate to the type of each part working on each one in parallel
