### System settings

System settings can be used to customise specific parts of the application by editing the content of files in the `server/system_settings` directory.
These can also be edited by the admin user via the Admin page.

## Database Configuration
The server uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a RDBMS system, ideally SQLite or Postgres. Set the database connection string via the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI environment variable.

The app also uses Flask-Migrate to generate and apply database migrations. Migrations are stored in the `server/migrations/` directory. Migrations are generated by making changes to `server/models.py` and running the command `pipenv run flask db migrate -m "<Migration Description>"`. This will create a new migration in the `server/migrations/` directory. The app will automatically attempt to apply a migration when first starting up if the database engine is postgresql. Alternatively, manually upgrading the database with the latest migrations can be done by running `pipenv run flask db upgrade`.
