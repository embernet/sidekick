# Contributing

Ideas for new features and bug reports are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss.

This project is in its early stages and in active development; the structure of the project and internal APIs are still being worked on and hence subject to breaking changes. Code contributions are therefore not invited at this time, however feel free to play and adapt according to your own ideas.
