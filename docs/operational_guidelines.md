# Operational Guidelines

1. **Dependency Management:** Keep track of the project dependencies and regularly update them to versions that are stable without vulnerabilitie
2. **Directory Structure:** Maintain a clean and well-organized directory structure that enhances code readability and maintainability.
3. **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information like API keys, database passwords should be stored in environment variables, not in the code. This is to avoid accidentally committing them to source control. See [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/config) for more details.
